# Data Prepper
Data Prepper is a **server-side data collector** capable of filtering, enriching, transforming, normalizing, and aggregating data for downstream analysis and visualization. Data Prepper is the preferred data ingestion tool for OpenSearch. It is recommended for most data ingestion use cases in OpenSearch and for processing large, complex datasets.

Two common use cases for Data Prepper are trace analytics and log analytics. 
### Trace analytics 
can help you visualize event flows and identify performance problems. 
### Log analytics 
equips you with tools to enhance your search capabilities, conduct comprehensive analysis, and gain insights into your applicationsâ€™ performance and behavior  

Data Prepper ingests data through customizable pipelines. A Data Prepper pipeline consists of the following components:

![alt text](image.png)

- One source
- One or more sinks
- (Optional) One buffer
- (Optional) One or more processors

### Minimal configuration

```yaml
sample-pipeline:
  source:
    file:
        path: <path/to/input-file>
  sink:
    - file:
        path: <path/to/output-file>
```

### Comprehensive configuration

```yaml
sample-pipeline:
  workers: 4 # Number of workers
  delay: 100 # in milliseconds, how often the workers should run
  source:
    file:
        path: <path/to/input-file>
  buffer:
    bounded_blocking:
      buffer_size: 1024 # max number of events the buffer will accept
      batch_size: 256 # max number of events the buffer will drain for each read
  processor:
    - string_converter:
       upper_case: true
  sink:
    - file:
       path: <path/to/output-file>
```

> In the given pipeline configuration, the source component reads string events from the input-file and pushes the data to a bounded buffer with a maximum size of 1024. The workers component specifies 4 concurrent threads that will process events from the buffer, each reading a maximum of 256 events from the buffer every 100 milliseconds. Each workers component runs the string_converter processor, which converts the strings to uppercase and writes the processed output to the output-file.
