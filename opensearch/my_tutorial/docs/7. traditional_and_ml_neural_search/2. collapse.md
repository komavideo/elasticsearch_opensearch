# Collapse Search Results

**Introduced 2.7**

The collapse feature allows you to collapse search results based on a field value. You can use this feature to remove duplicate results from your search and get a more diverse set of results.

The collapse feature works by selecting a single result, called a top hit, from each group of results that share the same value for the specified field. By default, the top hit is the first document in the group based on the overall sort order of the query. You can change this behavior by specifying an inner hits definition, which allows you to retrieve other documents in each group.

## Collapse Syntax

To use the collapse feature, add the `collapse` parameter to your search request. The `collapse` parameter accepts a field to collapse on and optional settings to customize the collapsing behavior.

The following example demonstrates the basic syntax for collapsing search results:

```json
GET my-index/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "title": "opensearch"
        }
    },
    "collapse": {
        "field": "user.id"
    },
    "sort": ["likes"]
}
```

In this example:
- The `collapse` parameter specifies that the results should be collapsed based on the `user.id` field.
- The `sort` parameter orders the results by the `likes` field.
- The search returns the top hit for each unique `user.id` value, sorted by the number of likes.

## Expand Collapse Results

You can expand the collapsed results to include other documents from each collapsed group by using the `inner_hits` option. This allows you to retrieve additional information about each group without changing the overall structure of the collapsed results.

The following example demonstrates how to use `inner_hits` to expand collapsed results:

```json
GET my-index/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "title": "opensearch"
        }
    },
    "collapse": {
        "field": "user.id",
        "inner_hits": {
            "name": "most_recent",
            "size": 3,
            "sort": [{ "date": "desc" }]
        }
    },
    "sort": ["likes"]
}
```

In this example:
- The results are collapsed based on the `user.id` field.
- The `inner_hits` definition specifies that for each collapsed result, we want to retrieve up to 3 additional documents from the same group.
- These additional documents are sorted by date in descending order.
- The overall results are still sorted by the number of likes.

You can also specify multiple `inner_hits` definitions to retrieve different subsets of documents from each group:

```json
GET my-index/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "title": "opensearch"
        }
    },
    "collapse": {
        "field": "user.id",
        "inner_hits": [
            {
                "name": "most_recent",
                "size": 3,
                "sort": [{ "date": "desc" }]
            },
            {
                "name": "least_recent",
                "size": 1,
                "sort": [{ "date": "asc" }]
            }
        ]
    },
    "sort": ["likes"]
}
```

This query retrieves both the three most recent and the single least recent document from each group.

## Limitations

The collapse feature has the following limitations:
- You can only collapse on a single field per search request.
- The field used for collapsing must be a single-valued field. Trying to collapse on a multi-valued field will result in an error.
- The collapsing is applied to the top hits only. The total number of hits in the response indicates the number of matching documents before collapsing.
- Collapsing is not supported in certain types of queries, such as `has_child` queries.
- Using collapsing can impact performance, especially for large result sets or when using `inner_hits` to expand many results.
