# Approximate k-NN search
Standard k-NN search methods compute similarity using a brute-force approach that measures the nearest distance between a query and a number of points, which produces exact results. This works well in many applications. However, in the case of extremely large datasets with high dimensionality, this creates a scaling problem that reduces the efficiency of the search. Approximate k-NN search methods can overcome this by employing tools that restructure indexes more efficiently and reduce the dimensionality of searchable vectors. Using this approach requires a sacrifice in accuracy but increases search processing speeds appreciably.

- The Approximate k-NN search methods leveraged by OpenSearch use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms from the nmslib, faiss, and Lucene libraries to power k-NN search.
- Of the three search methods the k-NN plugin provides, ANN offers the best search scalability for large datasets.
- These native library indexes are loaded into native memory during search and managed by a cache.
- To learn more about preloading native library indexes into memory, refer to the warmup API. Additionally, you can see which native library indexes are already loaded in memory. To learn more about this, see the stats API section.
- **Because the native library indexes are constructed during indexing, it is not possible to apply a filter on an index and then use this search method.**

## Recommendations for engines and cluster node sizing

- In general, **nmslib** outperforms both faiss and Lucene on search.
- However, to optimize for indexing throughput, **faiss** is a good option.
- For relatively smaller datasets (up to a few million vectors), the **Lucene** engine demonstrates better latencies and recall. At the same time, the size of the index is smallest compared to the other engines, which allows it to use smaller AWS instances for data nodes.

## Get started with approximate k-NN

To use the k-NN pluginâ€™s approximate search functionality, you must first create a k-NN index with `index.knn` set to true. **This setting tells the plugin to create native library indexes for the index.**

Next, you must add one or more fields of the `knn_vector` data type. This example creates an index with two `knn_vector` fields, one using faiss and the other using nmslib fields:

```json
PUT my-knn-index-1
{
    "settings": {
        "index": {
            "knn": true,
            "knn.algo_param.ef_search": 100
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "my_vector1": {
                "type": "knn_vector",
                "dimension": 2,
                "space_type": "l2",
                "method": {
                    "name": "hnsw",
                    "engine": "nmslib",
                    "parameters": {
                        "ef_construction": 128,
                        "m": 24
                    }
                }
            },
            "my_vector2": {
                "type": "knn_vector",
                "dimension": 4,
                "space_type": "innerproduct",
                "method": {
                    "name": "hnsw",
                    "engine": "faiss",
                    "parameters": {
                        "ef_construction": 256,
                        "m": 48
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, both `knn_vector` fields are configured using method definitions. Additionally, `knn_vector` fields can be configured using models. For more information, see [k-NN vector](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/knn-vector/).

> The `knn_vector` data type supports a vector of floats that can have a dimension count of up to 16,000 for the NMSLIB, Faiss, and Lucene engines, as set by the dimension mapping parameter.

Add some data:

```json
POST _bulk
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "1" } }
{ "my_vector1": [1.5, 2.5], "price": 12.2 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "2" } }
{ "my_vector1": [2.5, 3.5], "price": 7.1 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "3" } }
{ "my_vector1": [3.5, 4.5], "price": 12.9 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "4" } }
{ "my_vector1": [5.5, 6.5], "price": 1.2 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "5" } }
{ "my_vector1": [4.5, 5.5], "price": 3.7 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "6" } }
{ "my_vector2": [1.5, 5.5, 4.5, 6.4], "price": 10.3 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "7" } }
{ "my_vector2": [2.5, 3.5, 5.6, 6.7], "price": 5.5 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "8" } }
{ "my_vector2": [4.5, 5.5, 6.7, 3.7], "price": 4.4 }
{ "index": { "_index": "my-knn-index-1", "_id": "9" } }
{ "my_vector2": [1.5, 5.5, 4.5, 6.4], "price": 8.9 }
```

Execute the query:

```json
GET my-knn-index-1/_search
{
    "size": 2,
    "query": {
        "knn": {
            "my_vector2": {
                "vector": [2, 3, 5, 6],
                "k": 2
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## The number of returned results

- In the preceding query, `k` represents the number of neighbors returned by the search of each graph. You must also include the `size` option, indicating the final number of results that you want the query to return.
- For the NMSLIB and Faiss engines, `k` represents the maximum number of documents returned for all segments of a shard. For the Lucene engine, `k` represents the number of documents returned for a shard. The maximum value of `k` is 10,000.
- For any engine, each shard returns `size` results to the coordinator node. Thus, the total number of results that the coordinator node receives is `size * number of shards`. After the coordinator node consolidates the results received from all nodes, the query returns the top `size` results.
- The following table provides examples of the number of results returned by various engines in several scenarios. For these examples, assume that the number of documents contained in the segments and shards is sufficient to return the number of results specified in the table.

| size | k  | Number of primary shards | Number of segments per shard | Number of returned results, Faiss/NMSLIB | Number of returned results, Lucene |
|------|----|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 10   | 1  | 1                         | 4                            | 4                                        | 1                                  |
| 10   | 10 | 1                         | 4                            | 10                                       | 10                                 |
| 10   | 1  | 2                         | 4                            | 8                                        | 2                                  |


## Building a k-NN index from a model
For some of the algorithms that the k-NN plugin supports, the native library index needs to be trained before it can be used. It would be expensive to train every newly created segment, so, instead, the plugin features the concept of a model that initializes the native library index during segment creation. You can create a model by calling the Train API and passing in the source of the training data and the method definition of the model. Once training is complete, the model is serialized to a k-NN model system index. Then, during indexing, the model is pulled from this index to initialize the segments.

To train a model, you first need an OpenSearch index containing training data. Training data can come from any knn_vector field that has a dimension matching the dimension of the model you want to create. Training data can be the same data that you are going to index or data in a separate set. To create a training index, send the following request:

```json
PUT /train-index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "train-field": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 4
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notice that index.knn is not set in the index settings**

Add some data:

```json
POST _bulk
{ "index": { "_index": "train-index", "_id": "1" } }
{ "train-field": [1.5, 5.5, 4.5, 6.4]}
{ "index": { "_index": "train-index", "_id": "2" } }
{ "train-field": [2.5, 3.5, 5.6, 6.7]}
{ "index": { "_index": "train-index", "_id": "3" } }
{ "train-field": [4.5, 5.5, 6.7, 3.7]}
{ "index": { "_index": "train-index", "_id": "4" } }
{ "train-field": [1.5, 5.5, 4.5, 6.4]}
```

After indexing into the training index completes, you can call the Train API:

```json
POST /_plugins/_knn/models/my-model/_train
{
  "training_index": "train-index",
  "training_field": "train-field",
  "dimension": 4,
  "description": "My model description",
  "space_type": "l2",
  "method": {
    "name": "ivf",
    "engine": "faiss",
    "parameters": {
      "nlist": 4,
      "nprobes": 2
    }
  }
}
```

> As of 2.17, there is a [bug](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/issues/2138) with key `space_type`, instead use `spaceType`

The Train API returns as soon as the training job is started. To check the job status, use the Get Model API:

```json
GET /_plugins/_knn/models/my-model?filter_path=state&pretty
{
  "state": "training"
}
```

Once the model enters the created state, you can create an index that will use this model to initialize its native library indexes

```json
PUT /target-index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 1,
    "index.knn": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "target-field": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "model_id": "my-model"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add documents:

```json
POST _bulk
{ "index": { "_index": "target-index", "_id": "1" } }
{ "target-field": [1.5, 5.5, 4.5, 6.4]}
{ "index": { "_index": "target-index", "_id": "2" } }
{ "target-field": [2.5, 3.5, 5.6, 6.7]}
{ "index": { "_index": "target-index", "_id": "3" } }
{ "target-field": [4.5, 5.5, 6.7, 3.7]}
{ "index": { "_index": "target-index", "_id": "4" } }
{ "target-field": [1.5, 5.5, 4.5, 6.4]}
```

After data is ingested, it can be searched in the same way as any other knn_vector field

### Additional query parameters
```json
GET my-knn-index-1/_search
{
  "size": 2,
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "target-field": {
        "vector": [2, 3, 5, 6],
        "k": 2,
        "method_parameters" : {
          "ef_search": 100
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`ef_search` for e.g. specifies the number of vectors to examine in order to find the top k nearest neighbors
