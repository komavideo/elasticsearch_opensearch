# Keyword search
By default, OpenSearch calculates document scores using the Okapi BM25 algorithm. BM25 is a keyword-based algorithm that performs lexical search for words that appear in the query.

When determining a document’s relevance, BM25 considers term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF):

- **Term frequency** stipulates that documents in which the search term appears more frequently are more relevant.
- **Inverse document frequency** gives less weight to the words that commonly appear in all documents in the corpus (for example, articles like “the”).

## Similarity algorithms

The following table lists the supported similarity algorithms.

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| BM25      | The default OpenSearch Okapi BM25 similarity algorithm. |
| boolean   | Assigns terms a score equal to their boost value. Use boolean similarity when you want the document scores to be based on the binary value of whether the terms match. |

# Specifying similarity
You can specify the similarity algorithm in the similarity parameter when configuring mappings at the field level.

For example, the following query specifies the boolean similarity for the boolean_field. The bm25_field is assigned the default BM25 similarity:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "bm25_field": { 
        "type": "text"
      },
      "boolean_field": {
        "type": "text",
        "similarity": "boolean" 
      }
    }
  }
}
```
