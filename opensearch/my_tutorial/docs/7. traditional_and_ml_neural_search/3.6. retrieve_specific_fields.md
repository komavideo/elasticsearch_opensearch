# Retrieve specific fields
When you run a basic search in OpenSearch, by default, the original JSON objects that were used during indexing are also returned in the response for each hit in the _source object. This can lead to large amounts of data being transferred through the network, increasing latency and costs. There are several ways to limit the responses to only the required information.

## Disabling _source

```json
GET /ecommerce/_search/_search
{
    "_source": false,
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
or at mappings

```
"mappings": {
  "_source": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

## Specifying the fields to retrieve

```
GET "/ecommerce/_search/_search?pretty"
{
    "_source": false,
    "fields": ["customer_last_name", "product*"],
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

## Extracting fields with a custom format
```
GET /my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "fields": {
    "date": {
      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd"
    }
  },
  "_source": false
}
```

## Searching with docvalue_fields

To retrieve specific fields from the index, you can also use the docvalue_fields parameter. This parameter works slightly differently as compared to the fields parameter. It retrieves information from doc values rather than from the _source field, which is more efficient for fields that are not analyzed, like keyword, date, and numeric fields. 
> Doc values have a columnar storage format optimized for efficient sorting and aggregations. It stores the values on disk in a way that is easy to read. When you use docvalue_fields, OpenSearch reads the values directly from this optimized storage format. It is useful for retrieving values of fields that are primarily used for sorting, aggregations, and for use in scripts.

```json
POST ecommerce/_search
 {
   "_source": false,
   "docvalue_fields": ["day_of_week_i", "customer_id"],
   "query": {
     "match_all": {}
   }
 }
 ```

 ### Using docvalue_fields with nested objects
 ```json
 PUT my_index
 {
   "mappings": {
     "properties": {
       "title": { "type": "text" },
       "author": { "type": "keyword" },
       "comments": {
         "type": "nested",
         "properties": {
           "username": { "type": "keyword" },
           "content": { "type": "text" },
           "created_at": { "type": "date" }
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ```

 ```
 POST my_index/_doc/1
 {
   "title": "OpenSearch Basics",
   "author": "John Doe",
   "comments": [
     {
       "username": "alice",
       "content": "Great article!",
       "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"
     },
     {
       "username": "bob",
       "content": "Very informative.",
       "created_at": "2023-01-02T12:00:00Z"
     }
   ]
 }
 ```

 ```
 POST my_index/_search
 {
   "query": {
     "nested": {
       "path": "comments",
       "query": {
         "match_all": {}
       },
       "inner_hits": {
         "docvalue_fields": ["username", "created_at"]
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ```

 ## Searching with stored_fields

By default, OpenSearch stores the entire document in the _source field and uses it to return document contents in search results. However, you might also want to store certain fields separately for more efficient retrieval. You can explicitly store and retrieve specific document fields separately from the _source field by using stored_fields

>Unlike _source, stored_fields must be explicitly defined in the mappings for fields you want to store separately. It can be useful if you frequently need to retrieve only a small subset of fields and want to avoid retrieving the entire _source field

```
PUT my_index
 {
   "mappings": {
     "properties": {
       "title": {
         "type": "text",
         "store": true  // Store the title field separately
       },
       "author": {
         "type": "keyword",
         "store": true  // Store the author field separately
       },
       "publication_date": {
         "type": "date"
       },
       "price": {
         "type": "double"
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ```

 ```
 POST my_index/_doc/1
 {
   "title": "OpenSearch Basics",
   "author": "John Doe",
   "publication_date": "2022-01-01",
   "price": 29.99
 }
    
 POST my_index/_doc/2
 {
   "title": "Advanced OpenSearch",
   "author": "Jane Smith",
   "publication_date": "2023-01-01",
   "price": 39.99
 }
 ```

 ```
 POST my_index/_search
 {
   "_source": false,
   "stored_fields": ["title", "author"],
   "query": {
     "match_all": {}
   }
 }
 ```

 ## Searching stored_fields with nested objects

 ```
 PUT my_index
 {
   "mappings": {
     "properties": {
       "title": { "type": "text" },
       "author": { "type": "keyword" },
       "comments": {
         "type": "nested",
         "properties": {
           "username": { "type": "keyword", "store": true },
           "content": { "type": "text", "store": true },
           "created_at": { "type": "date", "store": true }
         }
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ```

 ```
 POST my_index/_doc/1
 {
   "title": "OpenSearch Basics",
   "author": "John Doe",
   "comments": [
     {
       "username": "alice",
       "content": "Great article!",
       "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"
     },
     {
       "username": "bob",
       "content": "Very informative.",
       "created_at": "2023-01-02T12:00:00Z"
     }
   ]
 }
 ```

 ```
 POST my_index/_search
 {
   "_source": false,
   "query": {
     "nested": {
       "path": "comments",
       "query": {
         "match_all": {}
       },
       "inner_hits": {
         "stored_fields": ["comments.username", "comments.content", "comments.created_at"]
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ```

 ## Using source filtering

 Source filtering is a way to control which parts of the _source field are included in the search response. Including only the necessary fields in the response can help reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and improve performance.

 >You can include or exclude specific fields from the _source field in the search response using complete field names or simple wildcard patterns

 ```
 POST my_index/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": ["price"]
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
```
GET /products/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "includes": ["name", "price", "reviews.*", "supplier.*"],
    "excludes": ["reviews.comment", "supplier.contact_email"]
  },
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "category": "Electronics"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using scripted fields

```
PUT /products/_doc/123
 {
   "product_id": "123",
   "name": "Smartphone",
   "price": 699.99,
   "discount_percentage": 10,
   "category": "Electronics",
   "description": "A powerful smartphone with a sleek design."
 }
 ```

 ```
 GET /products/_search
{
  "_source": ["product_id", "name", "price", "discount_percentage"],
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "category": "Electronics"
    }
  },
  "script_fields": {
    "discounted_price": {
      "script": {
        "lang": "painless",
        "source": "doc[\"price\"].value * (1 - doc[\"discount_percentage\"].value / 100)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
