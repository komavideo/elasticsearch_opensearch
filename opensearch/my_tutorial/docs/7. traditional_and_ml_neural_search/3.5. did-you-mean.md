# Did-you-mean
The Did-you-mean suggester shows suggested corrections for misspelled search terms.

You can implement the did-you-mean suggester using one of the following methods:

- Use a `term suggester` to suggest corrections for individual words.
- Use a `phrase suggester` to suggest corrections for phrases.
## Term suggester
Use the term suggester to suggest corrected spellings for individual words. The term suggester uses an edit distance to compute suggestions.

The edit distance is the number of single-character insertions, deletions, or substitutions that need to be performed for a term to match another term

The default analyzer (standard) splits a string at word boundaries, removes punctuation, and lowercases the tokens

```
GET ecommerce/_analyze
{
  "text": "Casual lace-ups - dark brown , Basic T-shirt - white",
  "field": "products.produce_name"
}
```

To get suggestions for a misspelled search term, use the term suggester. Specify the input text that needs suggestions in the text field, and specify the field from which to get suggestions in the field field:

```
GET ecommerce/_search
{
  "suggest": {
    "spell-check": {
      "text": "blzr",
      "term": {
        "field": "products.product_name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


```json
GET ecommerce/_search
{
  "suggest": {
    "spell-check1": {
      "text": "blzr",
      "term": {
        "field": "products.product_name"
      }
    },
    "spell-check2": {
      "text": "blck",
      "term": {
        "field": "products.product_name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Phrase suggester
To implement did-you-mean, use a phrase suggester. The phrase suggester is similar to the term suggester, except it uses n-gram language models to suggest whole phrases instead of individual words.

To set up a phrase suggester, create a custom analyzer called trigram that uses a shingle filter and lowercases tokens. This filter is similar to the edge_ngram filter, but it applies to words instead of letters. Then configure the field from which you’ll be sourcing suggestions with the custom analyzer you created

  "settings": {
    "index": {

        "analyzer": {
          "trigram": {

            "tokenizer": "standard",
            "filter": [
              "lowercase",
              "shingle"
            ]
          }
        },
        "filter": {
          "shingle": {
            "type": "shingle",
            "min_shingle_size": 2,
            "max_shingle_size": 3
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },

    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "trigram": {

            "analyzer": "trigram"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

      "text": "design paterns",
      "phrase": {

      }
    }
  }
}

        "gram_size": 3,
        "highlight": {
          "pre_tag": "<em>",
          "post_tag": "</em>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> By default, OpenSearch uses the Stupid Backoff model—a simple algorithm that starts with the shingles of the highest order and takes lower-order shingles if higher-order shingles are not found. For example, if you set up the phrase suggester to have 3-grams, 2-grams, and 1-grams, the Stupid Backoff model first inspects the 3-grams. If there are no 3-grams, it inspects 2-grams but multiplies the score by the discount factor. If there are no 2-grams, it inspects 1-grams but again multiplies the score by the discount factor. The Stupid Backoff model works well in most cases
