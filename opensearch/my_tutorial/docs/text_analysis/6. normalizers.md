# Normalizers
A normalizer functions similarly to an analyzer but outputs only a single token. It does not contain a tokenizer and can only include specific types of character and token filters. These filters can perform only character-level operations, such as character or pattern replacement, and cannot operate on the token as a whole. This means that replacing a token with a synonym or stemming is not supported.

> A normalizer is useful in keyword search (that is, in term-based queries) because it allows you to run token and character filters on any given input. For instance, it makes it possible to match an incoming query Naïve with the index term naive
