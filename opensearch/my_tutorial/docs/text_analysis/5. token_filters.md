# Token filters

Token filters receive the stream of tokens from the tokenizer and add, remove, or modify the tokens. For example, a token filter may lowercase the tokens so that `Actions` becomes `action`, remove stopwords like `than`, or add synonyms like `talk` for the word `speak`.

| Token filter | Underlying Lucene token filter | Description |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| apostrophe   | ApostropheFilter              | In each token containing an apostrophe, the apostrophe token filter removes the apostrophe itself and all characters following it. |
| asciifolding | ASCIIFoldingFilter            | Converts alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic characters. |
| cjk_bigram   | CJKBigramFilter               | Forms bigrams of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) tokens. |
| cjk_width    | CJKWidthFilter                | Normalizes Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) tokens according to the following rules: <ul><li>Folds full-width ASCII character variants into their equivalent basic Latin characters.</li><li>Folds half-width katakana character variants into their equivalent kana characters.</li></ul> |
| classic      | ClassicFilter                 | Performs optional post-processing on the tokens generated by the classic tokenizer. Removes possessives ('s) and removes . from acronyms. |
| common_grams | CommonGramsFilter             | Generates bigrams for a list of frequently occurring terms. The output contains both single terms and bigrams. |
| conditional  | ConditionalTokenFilter        | Applies an ordered list of token filters to tokens that match the conditions provided in a script. |
| decimal_digit| DecimalDigitFilter            | Converts all digits in the Unicode decimal number general category to basic Latin digits (0–9). |
| delimited_payload | DelimitedPayloadTokenFilter | Separates a token stream into tokens with corresponding payloads, based on a provided delimiter. A token consists of all characters before the delimiter, and a payload consists of all characters after the delimiter. For example, if the delimiter is `|`, then for the string `foo|bar`, `foo` is the token and `bar` is the payload. |
| delimited_term_freq | DelimitedTermFrequencyTokenFilter | Separates a token stream into tokens with corresponding term frequencies, based on a provided delimiter. A token consists of all characters before the delimiter, and a term frequency is the integer after the delimiter. For example, if the delimiter is `|`, then for the string `foo|5`, `foo` is the token and `5` is the term frequency. |
| dictionary_decompounder | DictionaryCompoundWordTokenFilter | Decomposes compound words found in many Germanic languages. |
| edge_ngram   | EdgeNGramTokenFilter          | Tokenizes the given token into edge n-grams (n-grams that start at the beginning of the token) of lengths between `min_gram` and `max_gram`. Optionally, keeps the original token. |
| elision      | ElisionFilter                 | Removes the specified elisions from the beginning of tokens. For example, changes `l'avion` (the plane) to `avion` (plane). |
| fingerprint  | FingerprintFilter             | Sorts and deduplicates the token list and concatenates tokens into a single token. |
| flatten_graph| FlattenGraphFilter            | Flattens a token graph produced by a graph token filter, such as `synonym_graph` or `word_delimiter_graph`, making the graph suitable for indexing. |
| hunspell     | HunspellStemFilter            | Uses Hunspell rules to stem tokens. Because Hunspell supports a word having multiple stems, this filter can emit multiple tokens for each consumed token. Requires you to configure one or more language-specific Hunspell dictionaries. |
| hyphenation_decompounder | HyphenationCompoundWordTokenFilter | Uses XML-based hyphenation patterns to find potential subwords in compound words and checks the subwords against the specified word list. The token output contains only the subwords found in the word list. |
| keep_types   | TypeTokenFilter               | Keeps or removes tokens of a specific type. |
| keep_word    | KeepWordFilter                | Checks the tokens against the specified word list and keeps only those that are in the list. |
| keyword_marker | KeywordMarkerFilter         | Marks specified tokens as keywords, preventing them from being stemmed. |
| keyword_repeat | KeywordRepeatFilter         | Emits each incoming token twice: once as a keyword and once as a non-keyword. |
| kstem        | KStemFilter                   | Provides kstem-based stemming for the English language. Combines algorithmic stemming with a built-in dictionary. |
| kuromoji_completion | JapaneseCompletionFilter | Adds Japanese romanized terms to the token stream (in addition to the original tokens). Usually used to support autocomplete on Japanese search terms. Note that the filter has a `mode` parameter, which should be set to `index` when used in an index analyzer and `query` when used in a search analyzer. Requires the `analysis-kuromoji` plugin. For information about installing the plugin, see Additional plugins. |
| length       | LengthFilter                  | Removes tokens whose lengths are shorter or longer than the length range specified by `min` and `max`. |
| limit        | LimitTokenCountFilter         | Limits the number of output tokens. A common use case is to limit the size of document field values based on token count. |
| lowercase    | LowerCaseFilter               | Converts tokens to lowercase. The default `LowerCaseFilter` is for the English language. You can set the `language` parameter to `greek` (uses `GreekLowerCaseFilter`), `irish` (uses `IrishLowerCaseFilter`), or `turkish` (uses `TurkishLowerCaseFilter`). |
| min_hash     | MinHashFilter                 | Uses the MinHash technique to estimate document similarity. Performs the following operations on a token stream sequentially: <ol><li>Hashes each token in the stream.</li><li>Assigns the hashes to buckets, keeping only the smallest hashes of each bucket.</li><li>Outputs the smallest hash from each bucket as a token stream.</li></ol> |
| multiplexer  | N/A                           | Emits multiple tokens at the same position. Runs each token through each of the specified filter lists separately and outputs the results as separate tokens. |
| ngram        | NGramTokenFilter              | Tokenizes the given token into n-grams of lengths between `min_gram` and `max_gram`. |
| Normalization|                               | <ul><li>arabic_normalization: ArabicNormalizer</li><li>german_normalization: GermanNormalizationFilter</li><li>hindi_normalization: HindiNormalizer</li><li>indic_normalization: IndicNormalizer</li><li>sorani_normalization: SoraniNormalizer</li><li>persian_normalization: PersianNormalizer</li><li>scandinavian_normalization: ScandinavianNormalizationFilter</li><li>scandinavian_folding: ScandinavianFoldingFilter</li><li>serbian_normalization: SerbianNormalizationFilter</li></ul> Normalizes the characters of one of the listed languages. |
| pattern_capture | N/A                        | Generates a token for every capture group in the provided regular expression. Uses Java regular expression syntax. |
| pattern_replace | N/A                        | Matches a pattern in the provided regular expression and replaces matching substrings. Uses Java regular expression syntax. |
| phonetic     | N/A                           | Uses a phonetic encoder to emit a metaphone token for each token in the token stream. Requires installing the `analysis-phonetic` plugin. |
| porter_stem  | PorterStemFilter              | Uses the Porter stemming algorithm to perform algorithmic stemming for the English language. |
| predicate_token_filter | N/A                 | Removes tokens that don’t match the specified predicate script. Supports inline Painless scripts only. |
| remove_duplicates | RemoveDuplicatesTokenFilter | Removes duplicate tokens that are in the same position. |
| reverse      | ReverseStringFilter           | Reverses the string corresponding to each token in the token stream. For example, the token `dog` becomes `god`. |
| shingle      | ShingleFilter                 | Generates shingles of lengths between `min_shingle_size` and `max_shingle_size` for tokens in the token stream. Shingles are similar to n-grams but apply to words instead of letters. For example, two-word shingles added to the list of unigrams `[contribute, to, opensearch]` are `[contribute to, to opensearch]`. |
