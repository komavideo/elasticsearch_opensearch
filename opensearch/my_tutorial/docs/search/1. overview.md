# Search

OpenSearch provides many features for customizing your search use cases and improving search relevance.

## Search methods

OpenSearch supports the following search methods.

### Traditional lexical search

OpenSearch supports keyword (BM25) search, which searches the document corpus for words that appear in the query.

### ML-powered search

OpenSearch supports the following machine learning (ML)-powered search methods:

**Vector search**

- [k-NN search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/index/): Searches for the k-nearest neighbors to a search term across an index of vectors.

**Neural search**: Neural search facilitates generating vector embeddings at ingestion time and searching them at search time. Neural search lets you integrate ML models into your search and serves as a framework for implementing other search methods. The following search methods are built on top of neural search:

- [Semantic search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search/semantic-search/): Considers the meaning of the words in the search context. Uses dense retrieval based on text embedding models to search text data.

- [Multimodal search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search/multimodal-search/): Uses multimodal embedding models to search text and image data.

- [Neural sparse search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search/neural-sparse-search/): Uses sparse retrieval based on sparse embedding models to search text data.

- [Hybrid search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search/hybrid-search/): Combines traditional search and vector search to improve search relevance.

- [Conversational search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search/conversation-search/): Implements a retrieval-augmented generative search.

## Query languages

In OpenSearch, you can use the following query languages to search your data:

- [Query domain-specific language (DSL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/index/): The primary OpenSearch query language that supports creating complex, fully customizable queries.

- [Query string query language](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/full-text/query-string/): A scaled-down query language that you can use in a query parameter of a search request or in OpenSearch Dashboards.

- [SQL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/index/): A traditional query language that bridges the gap between traditional relational database concepts and the flexibility of OpenSearch's document-oriented data storage.

- [Piped Processing Language (PPL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/ppl/index/): The primary language used with observability in OpenSearch. PPL uses a pipe syntax that chains commands into a query.

- [Dashboards Query Language (DQL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/discover/dql/): A simple text-based query language for filtering data in OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Search performance

OpenSearch offers several ways to improve search performance:

- [Asynchronous search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/async/index/): Runs resource-intensive queries asynchronously.

- [Concurrent segment search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/concurrent-segment-search/): Searches segments concurrently.

## Search relevance

OpenSearch provides the following search relevance features:

- [Compare Search Results](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-relevance/compare-search-results/): A search comparison tool in OpenSearch Dashboards that you can use to compare results from two queries side by side.

- [Querqy](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-relevance/querqy/): Offers query rewriting capability.

- [User Behavior Insights](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-relevance/user-behavior-insights/): Links user behavior to user queries to improve search quality.

## Search results

OpenSearch supports the following commonly used operations on search results:

- [Highlighting](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/searching-data/highlight/)
- [Pagination](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/searching-data/paginate/)
- [Sorting](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/searching-data/sort/)

## Search pipelines

You can process search queries and search results with [search pipelines](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/).
