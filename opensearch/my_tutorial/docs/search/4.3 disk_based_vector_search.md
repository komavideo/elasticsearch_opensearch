# Disk-based vector search
For low-memory environments, OpenSearch provides disk-based vector search, which significantly reduces the operational costs for vector workloads. Disk-based vector search uses binary quantization, compressing vectors and thereby reducing the memory requirements. This memory optimization provides large memory savings at the cost of slightly increased search latency while still maintaining strong recall.

To use disk-based vector search, set the mode parameter to on_disk for your vector field type. This parameter will configure your index to use secondary storage.

## Creating an index for disk-based vector search

To create an index for disk-based vector search, send the following request:

```json
PUT my-vector-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector_field": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 8,
        "space_type": "innerproduct",
        "data_type": "float",
        "mode": "on_disk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**By default, the on_disk mode configures the index to use the faiss engine and hnsw method**

> The on_disk mode only works with the float data type.
