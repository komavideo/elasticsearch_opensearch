## Refresh Search Analyzers
You can refresh search analyzers in real time using the following API. This requires the Index State Management (ISM) plugin to be installed. For more information, see Installing plugins.
### Endpoint
```
POST /_plugins/_refresh_search_analyzers/<index or alias or wildcard>
```

For example, if you change the synonym list in your analyzer, the change takes effect without you needing to close and reopen the index.

### Requirements
To work, the token filter must have an `updateable` flag of `true`:

```json
{
    "analyzer": {
        "my_synonyms": {
            "tokenizer": "whitespace",
            "filter": [
                "synonym"
            ]
        }
    },
    "filter": {
        "synonym": {
            "type": "synonym_graph",
            "synonyms_path": "synonyms.txt",
            "updateable": true
        }
    }
}
```
