## Simplified management of time series data:
- Data streams allow storing append-only time series data across multiple indices while providing a single named resource for requests. 
- They are well-suited for logs, events, metrics, and other continuously generated data.

## Automated Index Management

- Data streams can be used with Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) to automate the management of backing indices.
- This includes automatically moving older indices to less expensive hardware.
- It also includes deleting unneeded indices.

## Improved Performance and Resource Utilization

- Data streams help balance shards in the cluster, maintaining maximum performance.
- They provide an automatic, optimized data rollover strategy.
- This ensures data remains well-balanced across shards and indices.

## Simplified Querying

- Applications can submit indexing and search requests directly to a data stream.
- The data stream automatically routes requests to the appropriate backing indices.

## Better Handling of Irregular Data Influxes

- Data streams address limitations of traditional approaches (like daily rolling indices) when dealing with sporadic or irregular data influxes.
- They help manage variable index and shard sizes.
- This improves data compression and reduces shard hotspots.

## Streamlined Time-Based Operations

- Data streams use time-bound indices, with each backing index sorted by `@timestamp`.
- This allows opensearch to efficiently query only the relevant backing indices for specific time intervals.

## Reduced Operational Complexity

- Unlike rollover aliases, data streams don't require a bootstrap process for the first backing index.
- This makes them more suitable for scenarios where you can't predict when you'll start writing data.
