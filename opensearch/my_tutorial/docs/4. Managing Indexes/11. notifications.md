# Notification settings
## Introduced 2.8

You can use notification settings to configure notifications about long-running index operations. Set up automatic notifications when long-running index operations are complete by using Notifications in OpenSearch Dashboards or through the API.

Configuring notification settings is useful for long-running index operations, such as open, reindex, resize, and force merge. When you send a request for those operations and set the `wait_for_completion` parameter to `false`, the operation returns immediately and the response contains a task ID. You can use that task ID to configure notifications for this operation.
