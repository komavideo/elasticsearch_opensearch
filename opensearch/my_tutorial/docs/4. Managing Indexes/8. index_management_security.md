# Index Management Security

Using the Security plugin with index management lets you limit non-admin users to certain actions. For example, you might want to set up your security such that a group of users can only read ISM policies, while others can create, delete, or change policies.

All index management data are protected as system indexes, and only a super admin or an admin with a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate can access system indexes. For more information, see [System indexes](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/security/).
