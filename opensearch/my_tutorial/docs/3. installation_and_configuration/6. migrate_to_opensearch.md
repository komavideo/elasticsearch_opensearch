# Using snapshots to migrate data
- [OpenSearch Snapshot Migration Documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/upgrade-to/snapshot-migrate/)
- Look for compatibility across Elasticsearch (ES) and OpenSearch (OS) versions

| Elasticsearch OSS version | Snapshot migration path                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5.x                       | Upgrade to 5.6, then upgrade to 6.8. Reindex all 5.x indexes, make a snapshot, and restore in OpenSearch 1.x. |
| 6.x                       | Make a snapshot and restore in OpenSearch 1.x                                            |
| 7.x                       | Make a snapshot and restore in OpenSearch 1.x or OpenSearch 2.x                          |

There is a tool `opensearch-upgrade` in bin directory, though it is not a click-run-assume-all-good solution. There are steps to be followed. See [how it works](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/upgrade-to/upgrade-to/#how-it-works)

# Migrating Docker clusters to OpenSearch
- Both k8s and docker clusters (NEVER RUN `docker-compose down -v`). Volumes hold data and required to persist as nodes get decommissioned and new ones are instated

# Migrating from Kibana OSS to OpenSearch Dashboards
