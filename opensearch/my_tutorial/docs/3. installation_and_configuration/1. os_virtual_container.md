# Components
OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards are available on any compatible host that supports Docker (such as Linux, MacOS, or Windows). Additionally, you can install both products on various Linux distributions and on Windows.

## File System
- Avoid using NFS for node storage in a production workflow (NFS can negatively impact latency, performance, throughput, indexing performance, recovery time, and scalability).
- Use solid-state drives (SSDs) installed on the host for node storage where possible.

## Java
- Ships with a compatible [Adoptium JDK](https://adoptium.net/) version of Java in the jdk directory (Adoptium JDK is open-source and free for all uses whereas other JDKs, e.g., Oracle JDK, require a paid license for commercial use).
  
| OpenSearch Version | Compatible Java Versions | Bundled Java Version |

| 2.0.0–2.11.x       | 11, 17                   | 17.0.2+8             |
| 2.12.0+            | 11, 17, 21               | 21.0.4+7             |    

To use a different Java installation, set the OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME or JAVA_HOME environment variable to the Java install location. For example: `export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME=/path/to/opensearch-2.17.0/jdk`

# Network Requirements

- `cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count` - shows current system setting
- To increase the value, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf: `vm.max_map_count=262144`. Then run `sudo sysctl -p` to reload.
- **Temporary setting in shell**: `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`
- Read the above link for other settings
