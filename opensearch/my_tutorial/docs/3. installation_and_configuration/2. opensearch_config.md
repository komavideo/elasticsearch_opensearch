# OpenSearch Configuration

All settings can be set in `opensearch.yml` , that can be passed as configuration file 

## Configuration and system settings

### cluster.name 
**Type:** Static, string 
**Description:** The cluster name.
### node.name
**Type:** Static, string  
**Description:** A descriptive name for the node.

### node.roles
**Type:** Static, list  
**Description:** Defines one or more roles for an OpenSearch node. Valid values are `cluster_manager`, `data`, `ingest`, `search`, `ml`, `remote_cluster_client`, and `coordinating_only`.

### path.data
**Type:** Static, string  
**Description:** A path to the directory where your data is stored. Separate multiple locations with commas.

### path.logs
**Type:** Static, string  
**Description:** A path to log files.

### bootstrap.memory_lock
**Type:** Static, Boolean  
**Description:** Locks the memory at startup. We recommend setting the heap size to about half the memory available on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this limit. OpenSearch doesn’t perform well when the system is swapping the memory.

## Discovery and gateway settings

## Security Settings
- https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/security-settings/
- See `Client authentication settings` and setting `plugins.security.ssl.http.clientauth_mode`. You can see this in practice using python client (ssl_assert_hostname = False) when connecting to insecure cluster in addition to `use_ssl=False` and `verify_certs=False`

# Circuit breaker settings
Circuit breakers prevent OpenSearch from causing a Java OutOfMemoryError. The parent circuit breaker specifies the total available amount of memory for all child circuit breakers. The child circuit breakers specify the total available amount of memory for themselves.  

- You might see these exceptions when loading large datasets and memory usage for that specific setting exceeds the defaults. There are different types of settings and very valuable to look at in production scenarios

## Cluster Settings

## Index Settings
- https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/index-settings/
- There can be two types: cluster-lever and index-level
- **Dynamic cluster-level index settings**
  - `action.auto_create_index (Boolean)`: Automatically creates an index if the index doesn’t already exist. Also applies any index templates that are configured. Default is true.
  - `action.destructive_requires_name (Boolean)`: When set to true, you must specify the index name to delete an index. You cannot delete all indexes or use wildcards. Default is true.
  - Many more...
  - Understand the difference between open and closed indices. Some operations like changing analyzers require index to be closed. Use cases for closing include: 
    - Archiving old/unused data while preserving it 
    - Temporarily reducing cluster load
    - Performing certain maintenance operations

## Search Settings
- https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/search-settings/
- e.g. `search.max_buckets (Dynamic, integer)`: The maximum number of aggregation buckets allowed in a single response. Default is 65535.
