# Searches

Here's a comparison of Text search, Neural search, Semantic search, and Hybrid search in a tabular format with examples:

| Search Type   | Description                                                   | Advantages                                                                 | Limitations                                                             | Example                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text Search   | Uses exact keyword matching or basic text analysis techniques | - Fast and efficient<br>- Works well for structured data<br>- Easy to implement | - Lacks understanding of context<br>- Struggles with synonyms and related concepts | Query: "red shoes"<br>Result: Exact matches for "red shoes"                               |
| Neural Search | Uses neural networks to understand query intent and document relevance | - Can understand context and semantics<br>- Handles complex queries well | - Requires significant computational resources<br>- Needs large amounts of training data | Query: "comfortable footwear for running"<br>Result: Various types of running shoes, even if not explicitly mentioned |
| Semantic Search | Focuses on understanding the meaning and intent behind queries | - Understands context and user intent<br>- Can handle natural language queries | - May miss exact matches<br>- Can be computationally intensive | Query: "transportation in big cities"<br>Result: Information about subways, buses, and ride-sharing, even if not explicitly mentioned |
| Hybrid Search | Combines traditional text search with neural or semantic search techniques | - Balances precision of keyword search with understanding of semantics<br>- Can handle both exact matches and related concepts | - More complex to implement<br>- May require fine-tuning to balance different search components | Query: "affordable laptops for students"<br>Result: Exact matches for budget laptops, as well as semantically related results like Chromebooks or tablets suitable for education |

In this table:
- **Text Search** is the most basic form, relying on exact matches or simple text analysis.
- **Neural Search** uses machine learning models to understand queries and documents at a deeper level.
- **Semantic Search** focuses specifically on understanding the meaning behind queries and content.
- **Hybrid Search** combines multiple approaches to leverage the strengths of each method.

Each type of search has its own strengths and is suited for different use cases. Hybrid search aims to provide the best of both worlds by combining the precision of text search with the contextual understanding of neural or semantic search.
