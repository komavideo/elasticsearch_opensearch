# OpenSearch: Key Concepts
## Overview

OpenSearch is a distributed search and analytics engine supporting various use cases, from website search to security data analysis.

## Core Concepts

### Document

- Basic unit of information in OpenSearch
- Stored in JSON format
- Analogous to a row in a traditional database

### Index

- Collection of documents
- Similar to a database table

### Clusters and Nodes

- **Cluster**: Collection of one or more nodes
- **Node**: Individual server storing data and processing requests
- **Cluster manager node**: Orchestrates cluster-level operations

### Shards

- Subdivisions of an index
- Enable even distribution across nodes
- Each shard is a full Lucene index

### Primary and Replica Shards

- **Primary**: Original shard
- **Replica**: Copy of primary shard for backup and improved search performance

### Inverted Index

- Maps words to documents containing them
- Enables efficient full-text search

### Relevance

- Score indicating how well a document matches a query
- Based on factors like term frequency, inverse document frequency, and length normalization
- Uses BM25 ranking algorithm
