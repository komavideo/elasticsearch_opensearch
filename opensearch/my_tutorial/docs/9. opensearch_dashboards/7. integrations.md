# Integrations in OpenSearch Dashboards
The Integrations application in OpenSearch Dashboards provides a user-friendly platform for data visualization, querying, and projection of your resource data, such as flow logs. An integration asset, such NGINX or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), contains a bundle of metadata, data mappings, and visualizations, streamlining the monitoring of resource data without redundant configuration steps.

Available OpenSearch Dashboards integration assets are shown in the following image.

## Installing an integration asset
To install an asset, follow these steps:

- Go to Integrations > Available to view the available options.
- Select a tool, such as Nginx or Amazon VPC. You can choose Add to add or configure a new data integration using a prepackaged integration asset. You can choose Try it to test or explore the integration before fully adding it.
- On the Available page, select the Categories dropdown menu to filter the list of integrations.
### Try it demo
- On the Integrations page, select Nginx.
- Select the Try it button. The Try it option automatically creates a sample index template, adds sample data to the template, and then creates the integration based on that data.
- Select an asset from the Asset List. Assets include dashboards, index patterns, and visualizations.
