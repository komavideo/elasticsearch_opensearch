# OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch Dashboards is the user interface that lets you visualize your OpenSearch data and run and scale your OpenSearch clusters.

## Getting started

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [OpenSearch Dashboards Quickstart](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/quickstart/) | Learn about the basic concepts and features of OpenSearch Dashboards. |
| [OpenSearch Playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/home#/) | Explore features in OpenSearch Dashboards without downloading or installing anything. |
| [Install and configure OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-dashboards/index/) | Get started with OpenSearch Dashboards. |
| [Create visualizations](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/visualize/viz-index/) | Learn about visualizing data in OpenSearch Dashboards. |
| [Explore and query data](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/discover/index-discover/) | Learn how to explore and query data in OpenSearch. |

## Query languages

| Query language | Where you can use it | Description |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| [Query domain-specific language (DSL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/index/) | Dev Tools | The primary OpenSearch query language that supports creating complex, fully customizable queries. |
| [Dashboards Query Language (DQL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/discover/dql/) | Discover and Dashboard search bar | A simple text-based query language used to filter data in OpenSearch Dashboards. |
| [Query string query language](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/full-text/query-string/) | Discover and Dashboard search bar | A scaled-down query language whose syntax is based on the Apache Lucene query syntax. |
| [SQL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/index/) | Query Workbench | A traditional query language that bridges the gap between relational database concepts and the flexibility of OpenSearch's document-oriented data storage. |
| [Piped Processing Language (PPL)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/ppl/index/) | Query Workbench | The primary language used with observability in OpenSearch. PPL uses a pipe syntax that chains commands into a query. |

### Discover and Dashboard search bar

Using the search bar in the Discover and Dashboard apps, you can search data with the following two languages:

The following table compares DQL and query string query language features.

| DQL and query string query language | DQL | Query string query language |
|-------------------------------------|-----|---------------------------|
| - Wildcard expressions (DQL supports `*` only)<br>- Ranges<br>- Boolean operations | - Querying nested fields | - Regular expressions<br>- Fuzziness<br>- Proximity queries<br>- Boosting |

By default, the query language in the Discover search toolbar is DQL. To switch to query string syntax, select **DQL** and then turn off **OpenSearch Dashboards Query Language**. The query language changes to `Lucene`, as shown in the following image.

## Observability
