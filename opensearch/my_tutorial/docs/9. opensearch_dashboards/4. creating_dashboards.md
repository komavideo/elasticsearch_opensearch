# Creating Dashboards
- The Dashboard application in OpenSearch Dashboards lets you visually represent your analytical, operational, and strategic data to help you quickly understand the trends in your data.
- It provides a high-level view of key metrics, simplifies data exploration, and delivers insights when and where you need them.
