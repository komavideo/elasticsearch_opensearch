# Dashboards Query Language (DQL)

Dashboards Query Language (DQL) is a simple text-based query language used to filter data in OpenSearch Dashboards.

> DQL and query string query (Lucene) language are the two search bar language options in Discover and Dashboards.

## Search for Terms & Phrases

- Add sample data for ecommerce:

    - `men shoes` - Looks for "men" and "shoes" in all fields (matches shoes in sample ecommerce data).
    - `"men shoes"` - Looks for the phrase "men shoes" in all fields (returns empty in sample ecommerce data).

> Hyphens are reserved characters in Lucene, so if your search term contains hyphens, DQL might prompt you to switch to Lucene syntax. To avoid this, surround your search term with quotation marks in a phrase search or omit the hyphen in a regular search.

## Reserved Characters

The following is a list of reserved characters in DQL: `\, (, ), :, <, >, ", *`

Use a backslash (`\`) to escape reserved characters. For example, to search for an expression `2*3`, specify the query as `2\*3`:

- Load sample web logs:

    - `"GET /opensearch"` - Doesn't return any results.
    - `\"GET /opensearch"` - Matches messages containing the phrase.

## Search in a Field

The analyzer for the field youâ€™re searching parses the query text into tokens and matches documents in which any of the tokens appear.

- `tags: error` (sample data web logs)
- `tags: error, info`
